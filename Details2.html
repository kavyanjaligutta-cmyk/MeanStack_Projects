<h2>🕰️ Historical Timeline:</h2>
🏛️ Ancient Times (before 9th century CE)
Arunachala Hill and the site of the temple have been sacred for thousands of years.

Mentioned in Puranas like the Skanda Purana and Lingam Purana.

Worship of the hill itself as a form of Shiva predates the construction of large temple structures.

<h2>🛕 Chola Dynasty (9th – 13th century)</h2>
Major development of the temple began under the Chola kings.

Early stone structures, shrines, and towers were built.

Inscriptions from this period are found in the temple.

<h2>🏰 Vijayanagara Empire (14th – 17th century)</h2>
Greatest architectural expansion occurred under the Vijayanagara kings.

The massive gopurams (temple towers), pillared halls, and grand inner corridors were added.

The Rajagopuram, the tallest entrance tower, was constructed by Krishna Devaraya.

<h2>👑 Later Periods</h2>
Patronized by Nayak rulers, Marathas, and local kings of Tamil Nadu.

Regular maintenance and temple rituals continued through colonial times and after independence.

<h2>🔥 Religious Significance:
🔸 Legend of Arunachala (The Fire Lingam)</h2>
Lord Shiva once appeared as a column of fire between Brahma and Vishnu, who were arguing over supremacy.

Shiva declared that whoever could find the beginning or end of the fire would be the greatest. Both failed.

This column of fire became the Arunachala Hill, symbolizing Shiva as Agni.

<h2>🔸 Karthigai Deepam Festival</h2>
The most famous festival at this temple.

A giant flame is lit on top of Arunachala Hill every year during Karthigai month (November–December).

Symbolizes the divine fire form of Shiva.

<h2>🔸 Girivalam (Circumambulation)</h2>
Devotees walk around Arunachala Hill (13–14 km) on full moon nights.

This practice is believed to cleanse sins and bring blessings.
