        <b><h2>🌸<u>Historical Background</u></h2>
            <h3><u>1. Ancient Roots (Pre-Sangam Period):</u></h3>
            The origins of the temple are ancient—possibly as early as 6th century BCE, based on references in Sangam literature.
            
            The city of Madurai itself is believed to be over 2,500 years old, and the temple has been its spiritual and cultural heart.
            <br>
            
            <h3><u>2. Pandya Dynasty (7th–13th centuries):</u></h3>
            
            The Pandyas were early patrons of the temple. King Kulasekara Pandya is credited with building the early structure of the temple.
            
            The legend of Meenakshi, a warrior goddess who rules Madurai and marries Shiva, was popularized during this period.
            <br>
            
           <h3><u>3. Destruction by Malik Kafur (1310 CE):</u></h3>
            
            The temple was plundered and partially destroyed during the invasion by Malik Kafur, a general of the Delhi Sultanate.
            
            Many original sculptures and sacred texts were lost during this period.
            <br>
            
            <h3><u>4. Rebuilding by Nayak Dynasty (16th–17th centuries):</u></h3>
            
            The temple was extensively rebuilt and expanded by the Nayak rulers, especially under Tirumalai Nayak.
            
            Most of the present-day structures, including the stunning gopurams (gateway towers) and pillared halls, are from this era.

             Characterized by large gopurams covered with colorful sculptures.
            
            14 Gopurams: The tallest one (Southern tower) is over 170 feet high.
            
            Thousand Pillar Hall: Actually has around 985 intricately carved pillars.
            
            Golden Lotus Tank: A sacred pond where devotees cleanse before entering the sanctum.
            <br><br>
            <h3>🌺 <u>Religious & Cultural Significance:</u></h3>
            The temple celebrates the Meenakshi Thirukalyanam, a grand annual festival reenacting the celestial wedding of Meenakshi and Sundareswarar.
            
            It's a major pilgrimage site for Shaivites and Vaishnavites alike.
            
            The temple is also symbolic of matriarchal traditions in Tamil culture, with Meenakshi as the ruling deity.
