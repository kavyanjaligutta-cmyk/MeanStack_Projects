            Built around: 1003–1010 CE
            
            <h2><b>🔸 Purpose:</b><br></h2>
            To showcase the Chola dynasty’s imperial power and devotion to Lord Shiva.
            
            Also served as a center of art, culture, dance, music, and administration.
            
          <h2> <b> 🔥 Spiritual & Religious Significance</b><br></h2>
            Dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped here as Peruvudaiyar or Brihadeeswarar.
            
            The main deity is a massive Shivalinga, 13 feet tall.
            
            The temple is a representation of the cosmic structure with spiritual symbolism woven into its architecture.
            
            <h2><b>🏗️ Architectural Highlights</b><br></h2>
            🪨 Dravidian Architecture:
            Entirely constructed using granite, despite no granite quarries nearby — the stones were transported from miles away.
            
            Designed following Vastu Shastra principles.
            
            <h2><b>🔺 Vimana (Temple Tower):</b><br></h2>
            The main tower (Vimana) is 66 meters (216 feet) high, one of the tallest in the world for a temple.
            
            It is taller than the temple's entrance gopuram, which is a rare feature in South Indian temples.
            
            Topped with a 13-ton granite capstone, whose placement is still a mystery — believed to be placed using a 6 km long ramp.
            
            <h2><b>🎨 Murals and Sculptures:</b><br></h2>
            Intricate Chola frescoes still survive inside the sanctum.
            
            The temple walls and ceilings are adorned with mythological scenes, saints, and celestial beings.
            
            <h2><b>🕉️ Nandi Mandapam:</b><br></h2>
            Houses one of the largest Nandis (sacred bull statues) in India.
            
            Nandi is carved from a single stone, measuring 6 meters long and 3.7 meters tall.
            
            <h2><b>📜 Inscriptions & Records</b><br></h2>
            Over 100 inscriptions in Tamil and Sanskrit detail:
            
            Donations made to the temple
            
            Daily rituals
            
            Temple dancers (Devadasis)
            
            Revenue from lands
            
            These records provide immense insight into Chola administration and temple economy.
            
            <h2><b>🛕 UNESCO World Heritage Status</b><br></h2>
            Part of the Great Living Chola Temples (with Gangaikonda Cholapuram & Airavatesvara Temple).
            
            Recognized for its architectural brilliance, continuity of traditions, and intact inscriptions.
            
            <h2><b>👣 Legacy and Influence</b><br></h2>
            Inspired numerous other South Indian temples.

            Continues to be a functioning temple today, visited by thousands.
